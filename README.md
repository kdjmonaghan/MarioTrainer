# MarioTrainer
A modification of Super Mario 64 to enable easier practicing methods for speedrunners. This is a work in progress.

To compile any changes, please refer to [Glankk's n64 repository](http://github.com/glankk) and follow installation instructions from there.

When a more complete build is done for Mario, there will be install/download instructions here, also. :)
